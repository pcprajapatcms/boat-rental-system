== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the rental periods (day, half-day, etc.) be customized? =

The free version allows reservations minimum for a day. The customers can book the boat for 2 hours, but then the boat's next availability will be the next day.

= Can I allow boat owners to list their boats? =

Yes, since this plugin is an extention to WooCommerce, you can add your boats as products with product type: reservation.

= Will this boat rental booking plugin work for me? =

If you're the marina owner, you just need to add inventory in the admin panel and those will be listed in the advanced search page provided by the plugin.
Make sure that you select the product type to be "Reservation".

= How’s the availability of the boat calculated? =

The availability is calculated based on the reservations made by the customers. The customers can select the checkin and checkout dates from the reservation form.
After they complete their reservation, the dates are blocked on the availability calendar for that reservation item.
